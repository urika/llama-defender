Scheduler for rapid-mlx continuous batching.

This module provides a Scheduler class that manages request scheduling
using mlx-lm's BatchGenerator for efficient continuous batching.

The scheduler follows vLLM's design with:
- Waiting queue for pending requests
- Running set for active requests
- Continuous batching via BatchGenerator

    a per-row Python loop + ``mx.concatenate`` whenever
    ``any(self.samplers)`` is True. The Scheduler attaches a per-request
    sampler on every ``insert(...)``, so that branch is taken for every

    path that runs sampling once on ``[B, vocab]``.

    When every entry in ``self.samplers`` is the same callable instance,
    sampling is mathematically identical to invoking that one callable on
    the full ``[B, vocab]`` matrix (mlx-lm's ``apply_top_p`` /

    via ``_get_request_sampler``, so identity-equality of the entries in
    ``self.samplers`` already implies value-equality of the sampling
    params — no separate key check needed.

    This is the SERVER-SIDE wiring for
    ``--speculative-config '{"method":"mtp"}'`` (Gemma 4 external assistant
    + Qwen3.5 baked-in MTP).

    Gate (all required):
      * ``model`` exposes the ``mtp_generate_step`` protocol:
        ``mtp_forward``, ``make_mtp_cache`` (installed by
        :func:`~vllm_mlx.spec_decode.mtp.dispatch.dispatch_mtp_inject`).
      * ``batch_gen._generation_batch`` exists (mlx-lm 0.31+).

    On a gate miss, logs a WARN and returns ``False`` — the request
    continues on plain autoregressive decode.

    Hook shape: replaces ``GenerationBatch._step`` (mlx-lm 0.31+ shape:
    ``() -> (List[int], List[mx.array])``). Per-step, exactly one primary
    token is returned to keep the mlx-lm ``next()`` contract intact.
    Multi-token gains come from the generator's internal batched
    backbone+MTP passes (up to 2 tokens per pass), not from returning
    multiple tokens per ``_step`` call. Extra tokens produced by the
    generator are queued and drained on the following ``_step`` calls.

    K=1 chain-of-1 scope (PR-A of 0.9.13 stack):

    * Single-request only (``len(gb.uids) == 1``). Multi-request batches
      fall through to ``_orig_step`` — Gemma 4's MTP fast-path is
      batch=1-only (``mtp_forward`` raises on B>1) and the vendored
      generator maintains its own per-request state. Auto-K controller
      lives in PR-B; batched residual+bonus sync lives in PR-C.

    * Greedy sampling only (temperature == 0). Non-greedy falls through
      to ``_orig_step`` — the byte-lossless verify contract lives in the
      generator's residual-distribution sampling on reject, which the
      MVP does not exercise. Non-greedy support is a follow-up.

    * No logits processors. If any position of ``gb.logits_processors``
      is truthy we fall through — the generator has its own logits-
      processor plumbing but wiring the mlx-lm per-uid processor list
      through to the generator is out of MVP scope.

    * On the very first ``_step`` call we short-circuit and return the
      token that mlx-lm's fresh ``GenerationBatch.__init__._step()``
      already sampled and stashed in ``_next_tokens``. This preserves
      byte-equal output vs. baseline: the FIRST generated token is the
      argmax(prefill-final-logits), identical to plain decode. We seed
      the generator with that same token so its first backbone step
      produces the SECOND generated token.

            ``GenerationBatch._step`` contract maintains
            ``_next_tokens`` in a canonical shape so ``.filter(keep)``
            slicing and ``.extend(batch)`` concatenation see a live
            tensor at every step (initialized from ``inputs`` in
            ``__init__``, sliced by ``keep`` on request completion).
            The vendored wrapper's queue-driven emission path never
            touched those fields, leaving them frozen at the
            ``first_gen_tok`` staged by ``__init__``'s priming
            ``_step`` — a rank-1 uint32 that gets increasingly stale
            across the whole request.

            Round-J review: a prior revision drove the MTP generator
            one step ahead (a "prefetch") to publish the NEXT
            to-be-emitted token here, but that changed
            ``gb.prompt_cache`` state behind ``GenerationBatch``'s
            bookkeeping and swallowed generator exceptions (delaying
            the terminal-raise). Both were correctly flagged as
            unsafe.

            Simpler contract that satisfies round-I without the
            round-J side effects: stash the JUST-EMITTED token as the
            placeholder. Shape / dtype match mlx-lm's expected
            ``mx.array([tok], dtype=uint32)`` invariant so
            ``.filter`` / ``.extend`` slicing succeeds; the VALUE is
            semantically stale ("last emitted" rather than "next to
            feed"), but that's tolerated:

            * ``.filter(keep)`` / ``.extend`` don't forward through
              the model — they mutate the tensor in place. No
              downstream cache interaction.
            * Codex round-L BLOCKING #2-4 relaxed the round-H
              terminal-raise contract: the B>1 / non-greedy /
              logits-processor fallthrough branches now delegate to
              ``_orig_step()`` instead of aborting the request. In
              that handoff path, ``_orig_step()`` will read the
              stale ``_next_tokens`` and may emit a duplicated token
              or sample from a slightly stale cache position for one
              step. The wrapper logs a WARN (once per uid+reason)
              on the handoff so the operator can correlate the
              artifact with the load-balancing event. This is the
              accepted tradeoff for not killing the request — see
              :func:`_log_mtp_mid_stream_handoff_once` and the
              round-L rationale comments in the three fallthrough
              branches.

            Cache state stays under the MTP generator's control — the
            wrapper never advances ``prompt_cache`` outside a
            ``next(gen)`` call driven by an actual mlx-lm ``_step``
            request.

    Drafter-free spec-decode: a suffix-tree index over prompt + emitted
    tokens predicts repeated patterns. This is workload-specific, not a
    general accelerator: it can help long high-overlap copy/code-edit/
    repeated tool-XML traffic, and can regress ordinary chat or model
    families whose generated token path does not match the suffix drafts.

    The hot path lives in ``GenerationBatch._step`` (mlx-lm 0.31+):

      1. Drafter builds up to ``max_draft`` candidate tokens.
      2. We run ``model([X, d_0..d_{K-1}])`` of shape (1, K+1).
      3. Greedy compare argmax(logits[i]) vs draft[i]; accept up to
         first mismatch. ``n_accepted ∈ [0, K]``.
      4. Trim trimmable cache layers by ``K - n_accepted``.
      5. Emit ``n_accepted + 1`` new tokens: ``[d_0..d_{n-1}, bonus]``
         where ``bonus = preds[n_accepted]``.

    Wrapped ``GenerationBatch.next()`` augments the single Response
    that ``_step`` returns with ``n_accepted`` extra synthetic Responses
    so the engine sees the full token burst.

    Falls through to ``_orig_step`` when:
      - batch size != 1 (multi-request not handled in v1),
      - sampler is non-greedy (temperature > 0 / top_p < 1 / top_k > 0),
      - logits processors are configured (would need per-position apply),
      - drafter returns empty (low repetition).

    The architecture allowlist is enforced upstream via
    ``ModelConfig.supports_spec_decode``: hybrid linear-attention models
    (Qwen3.5/3.6 GatedDeltaNet, Granite 4 Mamba2) skip install entirely
    because chunked-batched verify isn't numerically equivalent to
    step-update on recurrent layers — see SUFFIX_POC_REPORT.md.

        and cannot fall back to bf16 mid-stream, so an incompatible first write

        are non-trimmable, so the supersequence fallback can't reuse
        the prefix either.

        Fix: when a request arrives with ``prefix_boundary > 0``,
        ``_schedule_waiting`` inserts it via ``insert_segments(
        [[prefix_seg, tail_seg]])`` so BatchGenerator processes the
        prefix segment as its own boundary. When that segment finishes,
        the response carries ``end_of_segment=True`` **without**
        ``end_of_prompt=True`` (the tail still has work to do). That's
        our cue to extract the cache via the public
        ``BatchGenerator.extract_cache`` API and store it under the
        ``prefix_boundary`` token prefix — so the *next* turn's lookup
        finds the boundary entry and skips re-prefilling the shared
        prefix.

        This uses mlx-lm 0.31+'s public cache-extraction API.

        Codex round 5 BLOCKING #2: returns the size in bytes of the
        KV-cache element dtype. Falls back to ``4`` (fp32) ONLY when the
        dtype genuinely cannot be determined — over-estimating is the
        safe direction for a TRULY unknown dtype (admission rejects a
        borderline request rather than letting it slip past the cap).

        Reads the element dtype from, in priority order:
          1. ``dtype`` — the MODERN HuggingFace/transformers key.
             ``torch_dtype`` was renamed to ``dtype`` upstream, so newer
             configs (e.g. Gemma 4) carry ONLY ``dtype``.
          2. ``torch_dtype`` — the legacy key, still emitted by older
             configs.
          3. The same two keys on a nested ``text_config`` — multimodal
             configs (Gemma 4, Qwen-VL) nest the language-model config
             there and may leave the top level without a usable dtype.

        Why this matters (gemma4-on-18GB false-rejection bug): reading
        ONLY ``torch_dtype`` meant a config that uses the modern
        ``dtype`` key fell through to the fp32 fallback, DOUBLING the
        projected KV (bf16 2 B/elem mis-read as fp32 4 B/elem) and
        rejecting at admission a request whose real usage fits under the
        cap. An MLX fp16/bf16 model's KV cache is 2 bytes/elem; fp32 KV
        is not a real MLX deployment, so the fallback should be the rare
        last resort, not the default for every modern config.

        Quantized KV-cache deployments are not auto-detected — the
        operator-tuned ``metal_cap_kv_bytes_per_token`` knob is the
        right escape hatch for those.

        Codex round 4 BLOCKING #1+#2 closure: the operator-tuned
        ``metal_cap_kv_bytes_per_token`` is still honored when
        explicitly set, but when it is 0 (default) we auto-derive a
        conservative estimate from the model config so the projection-
        based admission gate works OUT OF THE BOX without operators
        having to thread a per-model knob. Pre-fix, defaulting to 0
        meant the projection branch was effectively dead code unless
        operators set the field — which contradicted the PR's claim
        to fix the "currently below cap, one large prefill allocates
        past cap" failure mode by default.

        Auto-derivation formula (uniform baseline):
            ``2 (K + V) × num_layers × num_kv_heads × head_dim × dtype_bytes``

        ``dtype_bytes=2`` (fp16) is the conservative default for the
        dominant case; 8-bit / 4-bit KV-cache deployments OVER-estimate,
        which is the safe direction (a 4-bit user pays the price of an
        admission rejection at half the actual cap headroom — still
        better than the D-METAL-CAP cliff). Operators on quantized-KV
        deployments can pin a tighter value via the SchedulerConfig field
        to recover precision.

        Architecture-aware refinement (``kv_estimation``): the uniform
        formula counts EVERY layer as a full-growth attention layer,
        which over-estimates the per-token figure by up to ~2× for the
        hybrid architectures we ship — sliding-window layers (GPT-OSS,
        Gemma-4 local) are window-bounded, KV-sharing borrower layers
        (Gemma-4 ``num_kv_shared_layers``) allocate nothing, and
        recurrent / linear-attention layers (Qwen3.5 GatedDeltaNet)
        carry a fixed state. Once the uniform figure is computed we
        route it through :func:`kv_estimation.estimate_kv_footprint`,
        which decomposes the real footprint into THREE terms that the
        admission projection recombines per request:

          1. per-token GROWTH bytes — the full-attention layers only;
             the one term that scales linearly and unbounded with
             ``prompt + max_tokens``.
          2. a per-request SLIDING term — the sliding-window layers,
             charged as ``sliding_slot_bytes ×
             rotating_cache_slots(window, tokens)``. This is
             request-dependent and SUBLINEAR: it grows in ``step``
             blocks up to the window, then stays flat, so short
             requests are not charged the whole window. Cached here as
             ``_kv_sliding_slot_bytes`` / ``_kv_sliding_window`` and
             applied in :meth:`_estimate_request_kv_bytes`.
          3. a per-sequence FIXED baseline — recurrent /
             linear-attention state ONLY (a constant that does not grow
             with sequence length). Note: window buffers are NOT in the
             baseline; they live in term 2.

        The estimator is over-estimate-safe: a dense model or an
        unknown/stub config that exposes no ``layer_types`` /
        ``num_kv_shared_layers`` yields a BYTE-IDENTICAL uniform result
        (per-token unchanged, sliding + baseline both 0), so only
        recognized hybrids get the smaller, accurate number and the
        D-METAL-CAP OOM cliff is never re-introduced.

        Returns ``0`` only when the model config is missing entirely
        (e.g. unit-test ``MagicMock`` model) so back-compat unit
        tests that build a Scheduler against a stub model don't
        suddenly start rejecting requests that previously admitted.

        (auto-derived from model config or operator-overridden via
        ``metal_cap_kv_bytes_per_token``). Used by the admission gate to reject
        prefill requests that would push Metal active PAST the cap before the
        allocation happens (codex round 3 BLOCKING #1 + round 4 BLOCKING #1+#2 +
        round 9/10/11).

        The three terms model the three footprint shapes:

        * ``per_token_growth`` — the unbounded full-attention layers, growing
          with every token → multiplied by ``T``.
        * ``sliding_slot_bytes`` — the window-bounded sliding layers. Their
          buffer grows SUBLINEARLY (up to a rotating window, then flat), so we
          multiply the per-slot bytes by ``rotating_cache_slots(window, T)`` — an
          over-count-safe upper bound of the real ``RotatingKVCache`` allocation
          that rises with ``T`` and caps at the full window. Charging per request
          (not a flat whole-window baseline) stops a SHORT request from being
          over-charged the whole buffer and spuriously rejected (codex round 11
          BLOCKING #1), while a long request still reserves the full window.
        * ``fixed_baseline`` — the token-independent recurrent state.

        For a dense model the last two terms are 0 and this reduces to the
        historical ``per_tok × T`` — byte-identical. The sum is always >= the
        true architecture-aware footprint of the counted layers, so the gate can
        only over-estimate, never under-count.

        Conservative by design: we count both the prompt and the
        full ``max_tokens`` budget (rather than the much smaller
        first-step prefill), so the gate errs toward rejecting a
        borderline request rather than letting it slip through and

          ``mx.get_active_memory()`` climbs above
          ``metal_pressure_evict_fraction × _resolve_metal_cap_bytes()``.
          Requires ``gpu_memory_utilization > 0`` so the Metal soft cap
          is configured.
        * **R6-H6 (cache-self pressure):** when the memory-aware
          cache's own ``_current_memory`` ledger climbs above
          ``metal_pressure_evict_fraction × _max_memory``. Fires
          INDEPENDENTLY of ``gpu_memory_utilization`` — this was the
          missing trigger in 0.8.7 dogfood (31 GB cache / 35.5 GB Metal
          allocated, zero pressure evictions because the Metal cap
          was never configured).

        After each eviction we call ``mx.clear_cache()`` so the
        allocator actually returns slabs to MLX's free pool rather
        than holding wired memory pinned to the now-dead CacheEntry.

        Returns the number of entries evicted (0 if neither trigger
        fired, no cache is configured, or the cache had nothing
        eligible). Increments ``num_prefix_cache_pressure_evictions``
        for each eviction so operators can attribute pressure-driven
        eviction separately from the cache's own LRU-capacity
        eviction in /metrics.

        Implementation note: ``max_evict`` is bounded so a single
        pressure tick cannot evict the entire prefix cache and trash
        every in-flight hit-rate stat on a transient spike. The
        engine_core loop calls this method every 16 steps, so a
        sustained-pressure scenario still drains the cache within a
        few hundred ms.

        can be gone while ``running`` and the BatchGenerator uid remain.  The
        empty consumer can then be decoded forever and permanently occupies a
        ``max_num_seqs`` slot.

        After pending aborts have been drained, a running id missing from
        ``requests`` is impossible for a live request: normal completions are
        removed from ``running`` on the executor thread *before* engine cleanup,
        while disconnect cleanup deliberately removes ``requests`` first.  Use
        that invariant as a narrow executor-thread safety net and route cleanup
        through the same BatchGenerator-aware abort implementation.

        D-M01-2X + D-M01-DEAD (0.8.2 dogfood): this method MUST
        NOT discard ``_cancelled_request_ids`` /
        ``_disconnect_abort_ids``. Those are LIFETIME ledgers — the
        ``__init__`` comment block explicitly documents them as
        "every id that has ever advanced the counter stays in it
        for the process lifetime" with memory bounded by cancel
        traffic.

        Why the prior discard was a regression
        --------------------------------------
        On the production ``BatchedEngine`` over ``AsyncEngineCore``
        shape, an aborted request follows this sequence:

          1. ``stream_outputs.finally`` (or the deferred
             ``_await_and_record`` coroutine) calls
             ``scheduler.abort_request(rid)`` → adds to
             ``_cancelled_request_ids``, increments
             ``num_requests_cancelled``, queues into
             ``_pending_abort_ids``. Returns True.
          2. ``EngineCore._cleanup_request`` calls THIS method →
             previously discarded both ledgers. ``_pending_abort_ids``
             still contains the id (it's drained on the executor
             thread by ``_process_pending_aborts``).
          3. The other branch's ``scheduler.abort_request(rid)``
             (the disconnect_guard fires from up to three places,
             the async-fallback coroutine adds a fourth)
             re-enters the public abort. The membership predicate
             ``request_id in self._pending_abort_ids`` still
             evaluates True, so the abort is accepted. The
             ``already_counted`` read on the WIPED
             ``_cancelled_request_ids`` returns False, and the
             counter increments AGAIN — the 2x over-count.
          4. ``record_disconnect_abort`` then runs through the gate
             ``request_id not in self._cancelled_request_ids`` —
             which AGAIN reads from the wiped ledger and silently
             returns. ``via_disconnect_total`` stays flat-zero
             through every real disconnect — D-M01-DEAD.

        The fix: leave the ledgers populated for the process
        lifetime. Membership in ``_cancelled_request_ids`` is now
        a true "this id has already advanced the counter once"
        marker that survives ``_cleanup_request`` AND any number
        of redundant abort calls from the disconnect_guard's
        multi-branch fire pattern. The only paths that clear them
        are ``reset()`` / ``deep_reset()`` — see the codex r8
        BLOCKING #1 comment block in ``reset()`` for why those
        clear AFTER the abort loop.

        Memory: one ~36-byte uuid per cancel, same scale as
        ``finished_req_ids`` (which also persists across
        ``_cleanup_request``). The PR #783 docstring claim that
        "the only way a future ``abort_request(rid)`` can hit
        True is through a fresh ``add_request``" was wrong: the
        ``_pending_abort_ids`` membership branch passes True for
        the entire window between abort enqueue and
        executor-thread drain, opening exactly this race.

        Returns the popped Request (or None if already gone).
